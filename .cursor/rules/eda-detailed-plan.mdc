# Expand Agenda into Detailed Plan

## When
user types: "Proceed to next step for {project_name}"

## If
`projects/{project_name}/agenda.md` exists  
and `projects/{project_name}/detailed_plan.md` does not exist

## Then
Based on the content in `projects/{project_name}/agenda.md`, create a detailed plan in `projects/{project_name}/detailed_plan.md`.

Optionally, also consider any additional notes in `projects/{project_name}/instructions.md`.

For each slide, describe:
- Data transformations
- Graph types
- Table layouts
- Image placement (if any)
