# EDA Slide Generator

## When
user types: "Create presentation for {project_name}"

## If
{project_name} is not provided

## Then
Inform the user: "Please provide a project name. Usage: Create presentation for {project_name}"

## If
`projects/{project_name}` does not exist

## Then
Inform the user: "No project named '{project_name}' found in the projects folder."

## If
`projects/{project_name}/data/` does not exist  
or `projects/{project_name}/data/` is empty

## Then
Inform the user: "Missing or empty data folder in 'projects/{project_name}'. Please ensure data files are placed in 'projects/{project_name}/data/'"

## Then
You are an AI assistant helping generate an EDA presentation using Reveal.js. Based on the data in `projects/{project_name}/data/`, create a high-level presentation outline.

Optionally, also consider any additional notes in `projects/{project_name}/instructions.md`.

For each slide, provide:
- Title
- Purpose
- Description (e.g., show tables, graphs, images)

Save the result in `projects/{project_name}/agenda.md`.
